## 📌 Objective

Predict the **insurance cost** of individuals based on features such as:

- 👤 Age  
- 🚻 Gender  
- ⚖ BMI  
- 👶 Number of children  
- 🚬 Smoking status  
- 📍 Region

## ▶ Demo (Notebook Preview)

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_split=0.2)
````

✔ Train — Evaluate — Predict — Visualize
